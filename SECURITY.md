## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us via email at
**security@example.com** rather than opening a public issue.

When reporting, include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and
assess the issue, such as:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (including sample code, configuration, or data if applicable)
- The version(s) of the project you tested
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or screenshots

We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within **3 business days** and
to provide an initial assessment or next steps within **10 business days**.

After triage, we will:
- Work to verify and reproduce the issue.
- Determine the severity and affected versions.
- Develop and test a fix or mitigation.
- Prepare a security release and disclosure notes, when appropriate.

We follow a policy of responsible disclosure. We kindly ask that you do not
publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of
time to investigate and release a fix. If a CVE is appropriate, we will
coordinate with you on the details of the advisory and publication timeline.
